# This is the root

I have started my studies of Masters in Computing at National University of Singapore back in August 2024. Prior to that, I was a Relationship Manager with two local banks in Singapore for over 5 years with responsibility to manage the personal investment portfolio of affluent clients. While the journey in the finance had been rewarding financially, there was always something lacking that the job couldnt provide.

The satisfaction I gained when the client's portfolio had gained positive returns has diminished over the years. It became another day of the market, when the market is in celebration from the gains of previous days. It was just another day for me, when the market tanked from geopolitical news.. it is also just another day. I realised along the years, the achievement that once I pride of has been consuming me internally. When day after day, its just another day of dicussion of numbers on
papers. **not that the current path of computer science shorts in terms of numbers as compared, but we only deal with two numbers eventually...1 and...0 haha**
