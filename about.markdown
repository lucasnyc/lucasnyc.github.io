A little backstory from 2019 to 2024, I was a finance professional with two of the largest bank in Singapore as a Relationship Manager. It was a wealth management role for high net worth clients in the aspect of insurance, investment and treasury products. While I had been consistently ranked in the 90th percentile in revenue generation for the bank, I knew my passion and contentment from the achievements at work had faded. Throughout the dark period of Covid in 2020, where many social engagements are missing. I had plenty of time to myself to think about my future. Many thoughts had crossed my
mind. One that sticked on was, is this job the only thing I will be doing and be good at for the rest of my maybe decades of upcoming career?

Thats when I begun to started many new hobbies out of work. From surfing, diving, hiking, marathons, retro car restorations, learning musical instruments to expanding my knowledge in the finance domain. While many of the options explored had gave me a good but shortlived pump of adrenaline, to boost me with energy to continue working. The lack of passion and contentment drained me daily at work. And then I stumbled upon CS50x by Harvard. Hands down the best exploratory course I had, its a
newfound world outside of the physical world (not that CS is not based on physical). I was intrigued and yet felt defeated from time to time. Where the logic I used to apply in solving problems in other domain, felt insufficient to deal with very simple problems.
